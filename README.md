## How to Use the Application

This guide explains the workflow for using the IPO Investment Manager to perform single-session calculations.

> **⚠️ Important Warning:** This version of the application does **not** save your data permanently. All information you enter will be **lost if you refresh the page or close your browser tab**. Please complete all your work in one session and export your report at the end to save it.

### Workflow Steps

1.  **Start Fresh**
    * When you open the application, you will land directly on a clean, empty dashboard. There is no login required.

2.  **Create Your First IPO**
    * Click the **"+ Add New IPO"** button at the top right of the screen.
    * A new IPO will be created. Navigate to the **"IPO Details"** tab to give it a name (e.g., "LG IPO") and fill in the **Lot Price** and **Shares per Lot**. The Issue Price will be calculated for you.

3.  **Add Demat Accounts**
    * Click on the **"Demat Accounts"** tab.
    * Use the "Add New Demat Account" form to enter the account owner's name, a nickname for the account (e.g., "Zerodha-01"), and the commission rate, if any.

4.  **Add Participants**
    * Make sure the correct IPO is selected in the **"Select IPO to manage"** dropdown at the top of the page.
    * Click on the **"Participants"** tab.
    * Use the form to enter a participant's name, their total investment amount, and choose which Demat account their investment is tied to. Add each person in your group.

5.  **Record the IPO Results**
    * Once the IPO allotment results are out, navigate to the **"IPO Results"** tab.
    * Select a Demat account, set its **Allotment Status** ("Allotted" or "Not Allotted"), and if allotted, enter the **Selling Price**. The application will instantly calculate the profit and returns.

6.  **Save Your Work by Exporting the Final Report**
    * This is the most important step to save your calculations before you close the application.
    * Go to the **"Final Report"** tab.
    * Review the complete summary of profits and losses for each participant.
    * Click the **"Export CSV"** button to download a spreadsheet of your results. **This is the only way to save a permanent record of your work.**

After exporting your CSV file, you can safely close the browser tab.
